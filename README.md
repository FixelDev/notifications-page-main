## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

It was my first project using mobile first approach and I feel like it is a really good practise, so I'll use that method in the future, I also learned how to write cleaner SCSS code and of course I practised my React skills.
